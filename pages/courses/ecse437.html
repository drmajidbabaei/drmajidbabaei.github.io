Online live Sessions, over Microsoft Teams, are held on Mondays 12:30pm and Thursdays 1:30pm. These sessions, usually,
run for an hour. However, they may also run for less than an hour in case there are no further questions or discussions.
<br><br>
Lecture slides will be posted over OnQ. If you have questions and need clarifications about the lecture slides, then the live sessions will be the perfect location to get your questions answered and
clarified.

<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>Labs general directions:<br>
<ul>
When a Lab is released on this website the course instructure will let you know through email. You will get a posting-notification on OnQ anyways.<br><br>

You should submit (upload) your lab (Zipped file) onto OnQ before or by the due date. Depending on which group you belong to in the class, your lab (source codes and readme.txt file) will be reviewed and
marked by an assigned TA. Late work might not be accepted. See <a href="#LSP">late submission policy</a>.<br><br>

Labs are to be performed individually. Solutions are not released. Discussing your lab solution is welcome though.<br><br>

CISC324 does not have formally scheduled lab sections, so you may complete lab work anytime but not beyond the due dates. <strong>If you run into difficulty with a lab, contact a TA by email.</strong>
</ul>

</ul><p>Lab Instructions and Files: <ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 1</strong> (<a href="./OnQ.html">Lab_1.pdf</a>) [due Jan 22nd]<br>
In this lab, there are two exercises. In the first exercise you will be using the C-program in <b>eXer_1.c</b>. In the second exercise, you will be using two C-programs <b>eXer_2.c</b> and
<b>count.c</b>.
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 2</strong> (<a href="./OnQ.html">Lab_2.pdf</a>) [due Jan 22nd]<br>
In this lab, there is only one exercise. During this lab, you will be using the Java class file <b>ThreadAttacker.java</b> and the Java class file
<b>ThreadBot.java</b>.
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 3</strong> (<a href="./OnQ.html">Lab_3.pdf</a>) [due Feb 26th]<br>
This lab is challenging because it is your first time writing synchronization code. As a first step, study and execute the given code where readers have priority (course reader page 29). Make sure
that you can tell from looking at the output that readers are indeed getting priority. Then plan how to create code that gives priority to writers. The Java codes for readers having priority are:
<b>MainMethod.java</b> which is the main class, <b>Reader.java</b> which defines the readers class, <b>Writer.java</b> which defines the writers class, <b>RandomSleep.java</b> which defines a
class for random sleeping methods (you will need that to simulate a reader that is reading, a writer that is writing, and a reader/writer that finished then came back to read/write again), and
<b>Synch.java</b> which defines the class of semaphores that you will be using.
</ul>
<br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 4</strong> (<a href="./OnQ.html">Lab_4.pdf</a>) [due Mar 5th]<br>
This lab consists of implementing a synchronization code using Java semaphores to simulate the cars traffic around two regions. A car is initially driving around
Barriefield (East of Kingston) then crosses a causeway westbound to Kingston to enter a petrol station and fill up the fuel tank. Once done, the car drives back
to Barriefield crossing the causeway eastbound. Because of roadworks, there is onlt one lane that can be used to cross westbound or eastbound. You are given the
<b>MainMethod.java</b> file that contains the main method, the <b>Car.java</b> file that contains the car code, the Synch.java file that will contain the
semaphores and shared counters, the <b>Semaphore.java</b> that contains the semaphore class, and finally the <b>TimeSim.java</b> file that contains an accurate
time simulation written by Professor Blostein. The simulated time advances after all threads have reached a sleep() or acquire(). The implementation of
timeSim needs an exact count of the number of threads. Therefore, every thread you create has to begin by calling Synch.timeSim.threadStart() and has to
end by calling Synch.timeSim.threadEnd(). The car thread code in <b>Car.java</b> shows how to do this. Note that because Java's built-in sleep() method results
in inexact timing. For example, if two threads execute a sleep instruction at the same time, the thread that executes sleep(20) may wake up before the thread that executes sleep(10), you are provided
with the
TimeSim.java file to have a better precision in your simulation.
</ul>
<br>


<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 5</strong> (<a href="./OnQ.html">Lab_5.pdf</a>) [due Mar 26th]<br>
This lab consists of implementing a synchronization code using Java Monitors. It consists of two exercises: (1) The first exercise consists of writing synchronization code using Java Monitors for
the readers-writers problem (starvation free solution). You are given the solution with readers having priority in the following Java files: <b>MainMethod.java</b>, <b>Reader.java</b>,
<b>Writer.java</b>, <b>SharedDataStruct.java</b>, and <b>rwMonitor.java</b>. You have to modify the code so that the behaviour reflects a
starvation free solution (2) The second exercise consists of correcting a synchronization code using Java Monitors for the Bounded Buffer problem. You are provided with the following Java
files:
<b>MainThread.java</b>, <b>Producer.java</b>, <b>Consumer.java</b>, and <b>Buffer.java</b>.<br>
</ul>
<br>


<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 6</strong> (<a href="./OnQ.html">Lab_6.pdf</a>) [due Apr 9th]<br>
This lab consists of implementing a distributed application using Java sockets and Java RMI(Remote Method Invocation) message passing technologies to compare
multiple page replacement algorithms. You are provided with the following two java applications: (1)<b>T1.java</b>, <b>T2.java</b>, and (2) <b>Client.java</b>,
<b>Server.java</b>, <b>Server_Interface.java</b>. You can use those files as your building blocks for the lab. At the end of this lab, you will learn how to
write code that involves multiples processes/threads that communicate and cooperate over the network using message passing to share data and set up
synchronization.<br>
</ul>
